## Description

Observatory is a powerful "on demand" beatmap manager which uses osu!'s API and popular beatmap mirrors to prioritize speed and efficiency. It fetches beatmaps from the API's, and stores them in a local database for faster access.

## Features

-   [x] **Plug and play**: Just compile the docker image and run it. No need to worry about dependencies.
-   [x] **Don't worry about rate limits**: Rate limits are handled by the application, so peppy or beatmap mirror owners won't get angry at you.
-   [x] **Zoooooooooooom**: The application is designed to prioritize the fastest API's first to provide the best experience.
-   [x] **Long and reliable memory**: The application saves the data in database to avoid unnecessary API calls, also including TTL (time-to-live) for the data to be reliable.
-   [x] **Everyone loves caching**: We also have a caching layer between the requests and our database, which allows processing requests _blazingly_ fast.
-   [x] **Perfomance Points calculation**: If you're frequently calculating pp, you can use the `/calculator` endpoint, which utilizes [rosu-pp-js](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp-js) to compute pp, star rating and other related data.
